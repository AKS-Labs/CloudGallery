‚û°Ô∏è Yes, but **not fully end-to-end**.

### Q5: What happens if I uninstall the app?  
‚û°Ô∏è Your photos remain safe in your Telegram account.  
- The app only uploads; uninstalling doesn‚Äôt delete your photos.  

**Important Note:**  
- If you uninstall and reinstall the app with the same credentials, **you will not see old previously uploaded images** in the app because the Telegram Bot API **cannot read old messages without the correct chat IDs**.  
- To solve this, the app creates a **local database** on your device storing synced images, chat IDs, and metadata.  
- This database allows you to:  
  - Import it when reinstalling the app.  
  - Use it on another device to see previously synced images.  
- **Security Note:**  
  - The database is stored as a readable JSON file and is **not encrypted**.  
  - Anyone who gets access to this file can read its contents.  
  - You are responsible for keeping it safe.  
  - For safety, the app **daily syncs this database to your chosen Telegram chat** so you can restore it if lost.
